Welcome to the new Alumni Directory! If you 
have an active email on file, you should have

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,720
received an email from hello.alumni@williams.edu 
with a PIN and a link to set up your profile.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,920
To get started, click the link in your email, 
which will direct you to the setup page. Enter

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,240
the PIN provided in the “Temporary PIN” 
box, and then input your date of birth

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,200
in the corresponding field. Confirm that 
your email is correct, and click "Login."

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,680
If your PIN and date of birth match our records, 
you'll be prompted to create a password. Follow

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:36,360
the guidelines for a secure password, re-enter 
it to confirm, and then click "Set Password."

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,560
Once complete, the directory homepage 
will open. For further assistance,

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,960
click “Learn More” to access FAQs, 
resources, and documentation. You can

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,240
start by selecting “Setting Up Your 
Profile” from the options provided.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,520
If you didn’t receive an email with your PIN, 
visit the Directory homepage and click “Create

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,000
New Login.” This will take you to the registration 
page, where you can enter your information and

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,440
click "Continue." Shortly after, you’ll receive 
an email with your login link and temporary PIN.

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,920
Follow the same steps: click the 
link in your email, enter your PIN,

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,960
input your date of birth, and confirm your email.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
Please note, if you registered using 
"Create New Login," your access to

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,680
the directory will be limited until we have 
verified your alumni status. Once confirmed,

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,120
you’ll receive an email notifying you 
that your full access is now active.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Thank you!
